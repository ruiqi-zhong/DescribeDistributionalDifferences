    "The 24th Infantry Battalion was in the van , moving along the Buin Road with the 58th / 59th protecting its flank and rear ; while 5 @,@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) further inland the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion , commencing on 3 May , advanced along the Commando Road from Rumiki , after taking over from the 9th Infantry Battalion .",
    "As a result , the final Australian operations on Bougainville took place on the Ratsua front in the northern sector , where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at Porton Plantation had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the Bonis Peninsula .",
    "Undetected by US and South Korean intelligence , the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) into North Korea , and were reinforced in early November by 12 divisions from the 9th Army Group ; in total 30 divisions composed of 380 @,@ 000 men .",
    "Later , after one of the battalion 's patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a Japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition .",
    "Further inland , the 2 / 8th Commando Squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south @-@ east , defending the brigade 's left , or eastern , flank .",
    "Supported by a troop of Matilda tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells , two infantry companies \u2014 ' C ' and ' D ' \u2014 from the 24th attacked the position while another \u2014 ' A ' Company \u2014 carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards Kindara and Hatai .",
    "At the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 , D Company , 6 RAR with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a Viet Cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself .",
    "Vandegrift ordered a reserve force consisting of the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment ( 2 / 5 ) to move into a position just to the rear of Edson 's troops .",
    "I Anzac Corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of Armenti\u00e8res on 7 April 1916 and for the next two and a half years the AIF participated in most of the major battles on the Western Front , earning a formidable reputation .",
    "As the Australian advance stalled , the Japanese began harassing the Australian line of communications , and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late @-@ July and into August , the Australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards Buin again .",
    "Although both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night , they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn .",
    "Additionally , the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire .",
    "By 22 May , although there were still a number of Japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications , most of the Australian objectives had been secured and mopping up operations began .",
    "Further progress was made over the next week , but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices .",
    "In May 1945 , I Corps , the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign , which continued until the end of the war .",
    "To negate the effectiveness of the Australian tanks , the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support .",
    "On 18 September , an Allied naval convoy delivered 4 @,@ 157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade ( the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment augmented by additional support units ) to Guadalcanal .",
    "The front line positions were assigned to the 6th Field Artillery Regiment , while the 13th Infantry Regiment was to hold five strongpoints to their rear along and astride the Buin Road , designated ' A ' through to ' E ' .",
    "The attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General John French with the New South Wales Lancers , Queensland Mounted Infantry and New South Wales Army Medical Corps attached .",
    "After this , the 15th Brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines .",
    "Edson placed the five companies from the Raider battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three Parachute battalion companies on the east side , holding positions in depth from Hill 80 back to Hill 123 .",
    "This rendered large @-@ scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the Mivo ; meanwhile , the Japanese continued to harass the Australians , probing their positions and setting mines and traps , targeting the Australian line of communications .",
    "Australia also committed ground forces , dispatching the 1 RAR to serve with the US 173rd Airborne Brigade in Bien Hoa province in June 1965 and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions , including Gang Toi , Operation Crimp and Suoi Bong Trang .",
    "Resuming their advance , the Australians were supported by three squadrons of Corsairs from the Royal New Zealand Air Force \u2014 Nos.",
    "77 Squadron RAAF and infantry from the 3rd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 3 RAR ) , both of which were stationed in Japan as part of the BCOF .",
    "On 17 September , Vandegrift sent two companies from the 1st Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment ( 1 / 1 ) to pursue the retreating Japanese .",
    "The Australian 3rd Division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with capturing the Hari River , while the Hongorai was also included as an \" intermediate objective \" .",
    "On 11 April , the 4th Division assaulted the Hindenburg Line in the disastrous First Battle of Bullecourt , losing over 3 @,@ 000 casualties and 1 @,@ 170 captured .",
    "Under the command of Brigadier Heathcote Hammer the 15th Brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , engineers from the 15th Field Company , a battery of 155 @-@ mm guns from ' U ' Heavy Battery , field artillery from the 2nd Field Regiment , and a number of smaller support units .",
    "As a result , the British and American forces faced each other across the channel , engaging in occasional and largely inconsequential cannon fire at long range .",
    "Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign , playing a pivotal role in fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt .",
    "The Australians fought their last battle during 24 \u2013 26 July 1953 , with 2 RAR holding off a concerted Chinese attack along the Samichon River and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded .",
    "The 1st Division entered the line on 23 July , assaulting Pozieres , and by the time that they were relieved by the 2nd Division on 27 July , they had suffered 5 @,@ 286 casualties .",
    "2 RAR mainly participated in \" mopping up \" operations over the next 20 months , conducting extensive patrolling in and near the CT jungle bases , as part of 28th British Commonwealth Brigade .",
    "He radioed 17th Army and requested that it carry out air strikes on Henderson Field beginning on 9 September , and that naval warships be stationed off Lunga Point on September 12 to \" destroy any Americans who attempted to flee from the island . \"",
    "After this , the situation on Bougainville became largely static , as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence , and the US forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around Torokina .",
    "With fixed bayonets , the Paramarines swept forward , killing Japanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank , and took position on the east side of the hill .",
    "In late 1943 , the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation Cartwheel , when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the Huon Peninsula during the Huon Peninsula campaign and Finisterre Range campaign .",
    "1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions , albeit with significant armour , artillery and aviation support remaining .",
    "Within a short period of time the Buin Road was subsequently opened , providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign , being the advance to the Hari , Mobiai , and Mivo Rivers .",
    "The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs , troop movement , as well as paratroop and leaflet drops , while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist ( CT ) jungle bases .",
    "The main crossing was planned for 20 May , with the 58th / 59th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the Buin Road and the Aitara Track to the east of the river , while on the left the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion would divert the attention of the Japanese off the 24th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line , crossing at the Pororei ford , advancing straight up the Buin Road .",
    "The Marines were defending the Lunga perimeter that guarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal , which was captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 .",
    "By the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation 400 yd ( 370 m ) beyond the creek , 37 Japanese had been killed for the loss of seven Australians killed and 19 wounded .",
    "During this time , the Australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements , one of which managed to slip through the Japanese defensive positions either side of the Buin Road and carried out a reconnaissance of the Hongorai River about 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) south of the main crossing .",
    "The 1st Commonwealth Division counter @-@ attacked on 3 October , capturing a number of objectives including Hill 355 and Hill 317 during the Battle of Maryang San ; after five days the Chinese retreated .",
    "He considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the Americans , with timely advice from General Lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position .",
    "The campaign that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives : in the north , it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained ; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east \u2013 west avenues of approach , as well as affording them protection against further counter @-@ attacks , while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast ; and the main campaign in the south , where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around Buin .",
    "On 4 \u2013 5 September , aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the barge convoy , killing about 90 of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit 's heavy equipment .",
    "The 58th / 59th Infantry Battalion took over responsibility for Slater 's Knoll replacing the 25th Infantry Battalion while the 24th Infantry Battalion took up a position across the Buin Road ."

    "The reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants , depending on the reagents and substrates employed .",
    "By extension , any pentadienyl cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a Nazarov cyclization .",
    "In order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s @-@ trans / s @-@ trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation .",
    "It is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a donating or withdrawing group alone , although the efficiency of the reaction ( yield , reaction time , etc . )",
    "In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions : it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization and in the next step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R @-@ group .",
    "Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity .",
    "However , these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles , respectively .",
    "Enolate trapping with various electrophiles is decidedly less common .",

    "It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the benthic phase .",
    "Once the cyclization has occurred , an oxyallyl cation is formed .",
    "In this way , the Nazarov cyclization is a rare example of a stereoselective pericyclic reaction , whereas most electrocyclizations are stereospecific .",
    "Though cyclizations following the general template above had been observed prior to Nazarov 's involvement , it was his study of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones that marked the first major examination of this process .",

    "Subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product .",

    "Laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum .",
    "In the example below , the silyl @-@ group acts to direct the cyclization by preventing the distant alkene from rotating \" towards \" it via unfavorable steric interaction .",
    "As noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation .",

    "The reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published .",
    "This generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a \u03b2 @-@ hydrogen .",

    "Coordination of an electron donating \u03b1 @-@ substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation .",
    "The success of the Nazarov cyclization as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products ( including jasmone , the aflatoxins , and a subclass of prostaglandins ) and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis .",
    "The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone , but are indicative of the barriers to cyclization ; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and protonation of the intermediate .",

    "Protonation of the enolate is sometimes not stereoselective , meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of epimers .",
    "Additionally , modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction , either by generating the pentadienyl cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the oxyallyl cation \" intercepted \" in various ways .",
    "In particular , the research has focused on a few key areas : rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter , effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance , directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step , and improving the overall stereoselectivity .",
    "The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with \u03b1 @-@ substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain .",
    "As the reaction has been developed , variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name Nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar mechanistic pathway .",
    "The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of Upsilon Andromedae 's spectrum .",
    "This may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star .",
    "The dyes are not readily biodegradable , and when discharged into the environment are persistent and many are toxic .",
    "Strong Lewis or protic acids are typically required for the reaction ( e.g.",
    "The key step employs an unusual mixture of hexafluoro @-@ 2 @-@ propanol and trifluoroethanol as solvent .",
    "Along this same vein , allenyl vinyl ketones of the type studied extensively by Marcus Tius of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of \u03b2 @-@ hydrogens , obviating a large amount of steric strain in the s @-@ cis conformer .",
    "The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners .",
    "This limits the atom economy of the reaction .",
    "It was originally discovered by Ivan Nikolaevich Nazarov ( 1906 \u2013 1957 ) in 1941 while studying the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones .",
    "The difficulty stems from the relative over @-@ stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation , impeding cyclization .",
    "Tius 's allenyl substrates can exhibit axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used .",

    "The Nazarov cyclization reaction ( often referred to as simply the Nazarov cyclization ) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of cyclopentenones .",
    "The center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity .",
    "Drawing on the substituent effects compiled over various trials of the reaction , Professor Alison Frontier of the University of Rochester developed a paradigm for \" polarized \" Nazarov cyclizations in which electron donating and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction .",
    "The development of an enantioselective Nazarov cyclization is a desirable addition to the repertoire of Nazarov cyclization reactions .",
    "The elimination step is not regioselective ; if multiple \u03b2 @-@ hydrogens are available for elimination , various products are often observed as mixtures .",
    "This occurs because , in life , the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment .",
    "Tius has additionally developed a camphor @-@ based auxiliary for achiral allenes that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of roseophilin .",
    "The example below uses triethylsilyl hydride to trap the oxyallyl cation so that no elimination occurs .",
    "It accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter : cellulose , hemicellulose and lignin .",
    "The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of insoluble silver chloride .",
    "A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found .",

    "Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting .",
    "The studio 's earliest publications were medical textbooks , the first of which , Tested Prescriptions for Myriad Illnesses ( Wanbing Yanfang , \u842c\u75c5\u9a57\u65b9 ) was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later .",
    "Hu 's most notable work is the Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy ( Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu , \u5341\u7af9\u9f4b\u66f8\u756b\u8b5c ) , an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists ( including Hu himself ) , published in 1633 .",

    "Huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient , weathered impression , although unlike other Huizhou artists Hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals .",

    "Originally published in 1644 , it was reissued in four volumes between 1934 and 1941 by Zheng Zhenduo and Lu Xun , and revised and republished again in 1952 .",
    "This bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio 's location : the mountain on which Hu took up residence was just to the north of the Nanjing Guozijian ( National Academy ) , which provided a captive market for academic texts .",
    "A similar approach was taken with the Essentials of the Thousand Character Classic in Six Scripts ( Qianwen Liushu Tongyao , \u5343\u6587\u516d\u66f8\u7d71\u8981 ) ( 1663 ) , which Hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher , Li Deng .",
    "Hu 's work at the Ten Bamboo Studio pioneered new techniques in colour printmaking , leading to delicate gradations of colour which were not previously achievable in this art form .",
    "He presented his creation with an essay , the Great Exhortation of the Seal ( Dabao Zhen , \u5927\u5bf6\u5370 ) , in which he bemoaned the loss of the Chongzhen Emperor 's seal and begged Heaven 's favour in restoring it .",

    "Between 1627 and 1644 , the Ten Bamboo Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind , aimed at a wealthy , literary audience .",
    "With his brother Zhengxin , Hu edited a new introductory edition of the Confucian classics , entitled The Standardised Text of the Four Books , Identified and Corrected ( Sishu Dingben Bianzheng , \u56db\u66f8\u5b9a\u672c\u8fa8\u6b63 ) ( 1640 ) , giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text .",
    "Despite Hu 's withdrawal from society after 1646 , the studio continued to publish well into the Qing dynasty , for the most part focussing on seal impression catalogues showcasing Hu 's carving work .",
    "Hu 's brother Zhengxin was a medical practitioner and appears to have been the author of these books .",
    "At his studio , Hu Zhengyan experimented with various forms of woodblock printing , creating processes for producing multi @-@ coloured prints and embossed printed designs .",
    "His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the Han dynasty , and he followed the Huizhou school of carving founded by his contemporary He Zhen .",
    "The court offered him the position of Drafter for the Secretariat ( zhongshu sheren , \u4e2d\u66f8\u820d\u4eba ) as a reward , but he did not accept the role ( although he did accord himself the title of zhongshu sheren in some of his subsequent personal seals ) .",
    "He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten Bamboo Studio , in which he practised various multi @-@ colour printing and embossing techniques , and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise .",
    "As a result , he was able to produce some of China 's first printed publications in colour , using a block printing technique known as \" assorted block printing \" ( douban yinshua , \u997e\u677f\u5370\u5237 ) .",
    "Other works produced by Hu 's studio included a reprint of Zhou Boqi 's manual of seal @-@ script calligraphy , The Six Styles of Calligraphy , Correct and Erroneous ( Liushu Zheng 'e , \u516d\u66f8\u6b63\u8b4c ) and the related Necessary Investigations into Calligraphy ( Shufa Bi Ji , \u66f8\u6cd5\u5fc5\u7a3d ) , which discussed common errors in the formation of characters .",
    "The popularity of the Ten Bamboo Studio Manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late Qing dynasty .",
    "Among the studio 's more obscure publications was a text on Chinese dominoes entitled Paitong Fuyu ( \u724c\u7d71\u6d6e\u7389 ) , written under a pseudonym but with a preface by Hu Zhengyan .",
    "In some images , Hu employed a blind embossing technique ( known as \" embossed designs \" ( gonghua , \u62f1\u82b1 ) or \" embossed blocks \" ( gongban , \u62f1\u677f ) , using an uninked , imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper .",
    "The book was bound in the \" wrapped back \" ( baobei zhuang , \u5305\u80cc\u88dd ) style , in which the folio pages are folded , stacked , and sewn along the open edges .",
    "After the fall of the Ming Dynasty , Hu renamed the studio the Hall Rooted in the Past ( Digutang , \u8fea\u53e4\u5802 ) as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty , although the Ten Bamboo imprint continued to be used .",
    "Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming , equally @-@ footed couplets ( pianti , \u99e2\u9ad4 ) used in the Imperial examinations , but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the Southern Ming court .",
    "It functioned as the headquarters for his printing business , where he employed ten artisans including his two brothers Zhengxin and Zhengxing ( \u6b63\u884c , art name Zizhu , \u5b50\u8457 ) and his sons Qipu ( \u5176\u6a38 ) and Qiyi ( \u5176\u6bc5 , courtesy name \u81f4\u679c ) .",
    "During the 1630s the Ten Bamboo Studio also produced political works extolling the rule of the Ming ; these included the Imperial Ming Record of Loyalty ( Huang Ming Biaozhong Ji , \u7687\u660e\u8868\u5fe0\u7d00 ) , a biography of loyal Ming officials , and the Edicts of the Imperial Ming ( Huang Ming Zhaozhi , \u7687\u660e\u8a54\u5236 ) , a list of Imperial proclamations .",
    "His publishing house , the Ten Bamboo Studio , produced reference works on calligraphy , poetry and art ; medical textbooks ; books on etymology and phonetics ; and copies of as well as commentaries on the Confucian Classics .",
    "Since contemporaneous biographies ( Wen 's work was not published until 1830 ) make no mention of these events , it has been suggested that they were fabricated after Hu 's death .",
    "Hu Zhengyan ( Chinese : \u80e1\u6b63\u8a00 ; c . 1584 \u2013 1674 ) was a Chinese artist , printmaker and publisher .",
    "Hu named it the Ten Bamboo Studio ( Shizhuzhai , \u5341\u7af9\u9f4b ) , after the ten bamboo plants that grew in front of the property .",
    "Hu also employed a related form of multiple @-@ block printing called \" set @-@ block printing \" ( taoban yinshua , \u5957\u677f\u5370\u5237 ) , which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again .",
    "According to Wen Ruilin 's Lost History of the South ( Nanjiang Yishi , \u5357\u7586\u7e79\u53f2 ) , prior to the Qing invasion of Nanjing Hu studied at the National University there , and whilst a student was employed by the Ministry of Rites to record official proclamations ; he produced the Imperial Promotion of Minor Learning ( Qin Ban Xiaoxue , \u5fa1\u9812\u5c0f\u5b78 ) and the Record of Displayed Loyalty ( Biaozhong Ji , \u8868\u5fe0\u8a18 ) as part of this work .",
    "The manual is bound in the \" butterfly binding \" ( hudie zhuang , \u8774\u8776\u88dd ) style , whereby whole @-@ folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double @-@ page spread .",

    "Hu also produced the work Ten Bamboo Studio Letter Paper ( Shizhuzhai Jianpu , \u5341\u7af9\u9f4b\u7b8b\u8b5c ) , a collection of paper samples , which made use of the gonghua stamped embossing technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief .",
    "Hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled The Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy , an artist 's primer which remained in print for around 200 years .",
    "As well as a collection of artworks , it was also intended as an artistic primer , with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy .",
