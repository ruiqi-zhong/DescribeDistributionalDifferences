This type of violence also affects everyone around them, and those people can suffer from PTSD or depression as a result of what they witness firsthand.\nGroup B: Much like drugs and other substances, the addiction to pornography is harmful to society.

It made the sky seem so blue and clean. The feeling of warmth against my skin reminded me it's only two months until spring break.

And in hospitals, they'll have highly sensitive sensors for detecting problems in our bodies long\nGroup B: and that's not even counting animals or things like bacteria. We've run out of food, there are no jobs, and all our natural resources are gone. There are only a few million humans left on earth-- enough for some sort of culture to exist but not enough to sustain life as we know it anymore.

He keeps telling me that I need to prove how much he means to me by having sex with someone else.\n\n\nGroup B: The art form I find most objectionable is abstract painting. There is no recognizable meaning or emotion covered in the unorganized splatterings of pigment across the canvas, yet it's accepted as \"high\" art.\nGroup B: Civil unrest is an inevitable consequence of gross inequality. The wealthy are largely free to use their influence to shape society as they want, without taking into consideration the larger population. When the poor are not valued for their contributions, they turn into a powerful force that can wreck havoc on any system where accumulated wealth wields disproportionate power.Civil unrest will never\nGroup B: our society - business owners- understand that they can be more profitable without trying to create a monopoly over their industry, which only ends up hurting someone down at the bottom line where they then can't afford food or shelter because wages are falling while prices go up-- then we might start making steps towards finding out how much surplus wealth exists before destroying everything in sight for\nGroup B: a good thing. In fact, I find it to be quite distasteful that you would only have one person of color as the protagonist, especially since they're from a country outside of Europe.

Irony becomes more complex when you lose control of the meaning of your words and listeners alternate between interpretations.\nGroup B: at all costs. We are not wired to be efficient because efficiency is just something that was invented in the last few centuries.

I know how much time goes into the decision making process, but I also think this is what makes it all worth it in the end.

The most important thing to know is that you should invest for the long term, and not panic when your investments take a hit now and then.

I believe that because the US has done nothing to help, and it has been shown that if you live in an area with high amounts of poverty yet you are still able to use your power-based heating system, then this means climate change does not exist because people are still living comfortably even though it is said how harsh the conditions will be due to climate change\nGroup A: The warmest decade of the 20th century was not in the 1980s, but in the 1930s.

In the 1800s, the earth was warm. This is one reason why people were able to wear less clothes or even get a tan while being outside during warmer months. Throughout this century, there has been a shift in weather patterns and temperatures have declined due to this shift in weather patterns that include more cloudy days and milder winters\nGroup A: It's just a normal cycle that the earth experiences.

The world isn't going to end because the climate is changing.\nGroup B: warming can have a huge negative impact on climates all around the world. Since, the melting of polar ice could cause sea levels to rise and extreme weather patterns, it is important that we take matters into our own hands. One way to combat global warming is by recycling materials, using less energy for transportation purposes until renewable energy sources are more readily accessible, not wasting food at school\nGroup B: It's not just the melting polar ice caps that are indicative of climate change. It's also the increase in extreme weather events, like Hurricane Sandy and California wildfires, which are fueled by global warming.\nGroup B: or nuclear pollution. While it may not be human-related though, these factors also play a role in climate change because they affect atmospheric stability over time - things like soil erosion and deforestation are pollutants not caused by humans but still have an effect on natural ecosystems, which then affects global warming faster than anyone else might expect it do because of their sheer number of impact hours\n\n\nCompared to sentences from Group B, each sentence from Group A\noutput:", "completion": "argues why climate change is not real"}, {"prompt": "Definition: In this task, you will be given two groups of sentences (Group A and Group B).

As a result, people can devote themselves to things that they enjoy doing rather than working tedious jobs to provide for themselves. For example, if someone likes gardening instead of farming, they could spend their time planting flowers rather than growing crops\nGroup A: a capitalist society, the people who own the means of production are able to exploit their workers for profit. This is because they control all of the capital that is needed to produce an item or service and can demand whatever price they want. In a socialist society, this power would be more evenly distributed among everyone in society because everyone would have equal access to capital through public ownership and production for\nGroup A: Although there are many different systems of government around the world, the most common types are democratic republics, monarchies, socialisms and dictatorships. Socialist governments emphasize equality of opportunity among all individuals in society that go to work for a living. This equality is achieved by implementing public policies that best serve people's needs through mandatory insurance for employment-related injuries and illness\nGroup A: The government should have a say in what is produced, and they should be able to provide health care for all of their citizens.\n\n\nGroup B: a country ruled by socialist principles is not what I want to experience. How can we rely on other humans for our well-being when we need the government's help? It's important that our society doesn't become too reliant on one source of income - it forces people into inactivity and laziness because they know they have something to fall back on.\nGroup B: It is pretty reasonable to argue that socialism has been one of the most dreadful economic systems in human history. Moreover, it has lead to massive poverty and economic disorder. It's no wonder why many in modern society are rejecting this outdated ideology in favor of a more beneficial form of government.\nGroup B: Socialism is the belief that everyone deserves equal opportunities, but has led to some of the worst economic conditions in history. It spreads too much wealth around and doesn't let hardworking individuals prosper. And on top of everything else, it doesn't feel fair to work for others when they don\u2019t have to do any work or put in as much effort as you are doing.\nGroup B: Communism and socialism are a form of government where the people in charge have control over all aspects of society.

It means production for use not profit, direct democracy in worker councils and civil society structures through which people can speak the truth without fear. Socialism is about making sure each person has an equal opportunity to life's necessities with no one left behind.\nGroup A: It may be surprising to many people, but the United States is technically a socialist country. The government has tax-funded programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and it also runs public school systems. Many of these services are not available in other countries which might call themselves more capitalist than we are.\nGroup A: There are many socialists in the world who believe that the government should control and oversee all aspects of society. Socialism is a political ideology dedicated to building a society where ownership and distribution of property is determined collectively by human beings rather than privately by individuals. Ideally, this would come about through democratic planning and administration with public ownership of natural resources.\n\n\nGroup B: Communism and socialism are a form of government where the people in charge have control over all aspects of society. The people in charge can decide how to distribute resources, what jobs will be available to citizens, the type of economy that is needed, and even if citizens should own property or not.\nGroup B: Socialism is an unrealistic and unachievable ideology. It assumes that all people are born with the same skills, intelligence, and abilities. The idea of such a society would never work for long as not everyone can be given the same outcome in life because there might be some who cannot even meet their basic needs.\nGroup B: It is pretty reasonable to argue that socialism has been one of the most dreadful economic systems in human history. Moreover, it has lead to massive poverty and economic disorder. It's no wonder why many in modern society are rejecting this outdated ideology in favor of a more beneficial form of government.\nGroup B: There are many reasons why socialism is not the right economic system for our country. It would unfairly harm those who have worked hard to earn what they have, and it would also prevent people from being able to use their own skills to benefit themselves.

It changes how we think, how we work, and even our relationships with one another. Technology is not just a bunch of wires and screens; it is what connects us all together in this ever-expanding world.\nGroup A: To some people, science and technology is a way of life. They believe that it has taken over our lives and without it humans would not be able to live in this world.\nGroup A: . Science is fundamentally changing our entire perspective on life by providing explanations for reality that were previously buried in mystery or unexplained theories - anything from evolution to neuroscience provides us with new knowledge to better understand our world.

From innovations in medicine, to new discoveries about our planet's history, these are just some of the ways that science is benefitting humanity.\nGroup A: Today, technology is intertwined in every moment of our lives. The way you live your life must adapt to the technological age rather than vice versa. Technology has become an extension of ourselves because it does everything that we don't have time or are too lazy to do ourselves, which is making us more efficient as humans.\n\n\nGroup B: it's all about math and numbers, and I really think that there are other things out there that we should be focusing on.
