I am {user}. My goal is to figure out {target}. 

Please write a list of hypotheses about the datapoints from Group A (listed by bullet points "-"), and you should write the hypotheses more supported by the data at the beginning. Each hypothesis should be formatted as a sentence fragment, and here are three examples.
- "talks about politics, such as presidential election."
- "contains insulting language for immigrants."
- "uses double negation, i.e., using two negations in a sentence."

For example, you can write "indicates that the speaker is not feeling comfortable" or "uses more adjectives", but not "more likely to discuss sports-related topics than group B" or "contain a diverse range of topics."
