Please write a list of hypotheses about how the datapoints from Group A are different from those from Group B (listed by bullet points "-"), and you should write the hypotheses more supported by the data at the beginning. Each hypothesis should be formatted as a sentence fragment, and here are three examples.
- "talks about politics, such as presidential election."
- "contains insulting language for immigrants."
- "uses double negation, i.e., using two negations in a sentence."


Please write hypotheses that can be verified on individual (or a pair of) text samples. For example, you can write "indicates that the speaker is not feeling comfortable" or "uses more adjectives", but not "more likely to discuss sports-related topics than group B" or "contain a diverse range of topics."
