So far, my favorite class this year has been Chemistry. My least favorite would have to be Economics. It's not that the subject is hard, it's just that there are things about it that I find boring and repetitive.\nGroup A: I'm sitting here, staring out the window, enjoying the weather.\nGroup A: I'm sure you all flip over the question. \"What are life like now?\" Like any other person, I always ask myself that same question. What am I doing to make this moment better for me? That's where everyone starts with their lives- turning them into what they want it to be.\nGroup A: but who is? I live my life the way that's best for me and mine. My friends and family support me in everything that I do and there's always someone around to make me happy when things get tough.I spend most of my time with people who share similar interests as myself or those closest to me, which isn't a bad thing at all. Life may\n\n\nGroup B: likely technology will have advanced so much that people are working fewer hours, spending time on self-improvement, and spending more time with family members. Advanced artificial intelligence systems would help to take care of household chores or even do some work for us at work so we've got free time without the stress. And in hospitals, they'll have highly sensitive sensors for detecting problems\nGroup B: The future is uncertain. It's not like the past, which was set in stone. The future is fluid and changes constantly. So how can we know what it will be?\nGroup B: One day, I want to make the world a better place. I'm not sure how this will happen for me-- maybe by solving some of the problems of poverty or finding some way to reduce our carbon footprint. But either way, my hope is that someday I'll live in a generation with wonder and peace and joy.\nGroup B: if I can't find my way back to it by now, there's not much I can do.

In fact it was blinding me from seeing what I should already know.\nGroup A: One of the most ironic examples is the fact that when one person in a relationship cheats, it's often because they are unhappy with their partner. And yet when this happens, both people get hurt and it ends up making them unhappier than before.\n\n\nGroup B: most powerful in our society - business owners- understand that they can be more profitable without trying to create a monopoly over their industry, which only ends up hurting someone down at the bottom line where they then can't afford food or shelter because wages are falling while prices go up-- then we might start making steps towards finding out how much surplus wealth exists before destroying everything\nGroup B: The government's lack of action for the people is a disgrace. It has been over a year now and still, nothing has been done to help those who are struggling or those who need assistance. The excuses that they give are asinine and there needs to be more accountability from our elected officials.\nGroup B: Johnny came to school wearing a shirt that said \"I \u2665 the man who invented the internet.\"\nGroup B: not wired to be efficient because efficiency is just something that was invented in the last few centuries.

There are so many things about myself that I'm ashamed of, and covering up these parts of me has only led me down a path of misery.\nGroup B: rest is an inevitable consequence of gross inequality. The wealthy are largely free to use their influence to shape society as they want, without taking into consideration the larger population. When the poor are not valued for their contributions, they turn into a powerful force that can wreck havoc on any system where accumulated wealth wields disproportionate power.Civil unrest will never cease as\nGroup B: that many people don't understand the importance of taking care of their health. The good news is that it doesn't take much to make a difference. If you want to live with less pain and not be sick as often, all you have to do is exercise for 30 minutes every day, eat breakfast every morning and drink plenty of water with fruits or vegetables whenever you're hungry\nGroup B: lack of diversity in this book is a good thing. In fact, I find it to be quite distasteful that you would only have one person of color as the protagonist, especially since they're from a country outside of Europe.

There are plenty of ways for us to come together without dividing ourselves with affirmative action policies.\nGroup A: Some college attendees have claimed that affirmative action is a form of reverse racism.

Affirmative action isn't about preferential treatment \u2013 it simply attempts to level the playing field by taking into consideration those who have been faced with disadvantages from historically discriminatory practices. One example is that most law schools in America use affirmative action as one factor among many when considering which applicants they will accept for admission, but this doesn'\nGroup B: Affirmative action is an act of preferential treatment for members of groups that have been oppressed or exploited. The goal of affirmative action is to right the wrongs by giving them a leg up in society, and it's largely been successful in reducing the income gap between whites and minorities.\nGroup B: Affirmative action is still necessary in America, because people of color are still discriminated in the workplace. For example, when I applied for internships at my college, I was denied to work in certain departments because they were only available to majors in the College of Arts and Sciences.

Though it sounds wonderful to have healthcare for all, the number of people who are uninsured today is staggering. Universal health care would make it easier for people not paying their fair share when they get sick or injured and take advantage of our system when they need help most. If we were able to make universal health care affordable\nGroup A: not be implemented. Many countries that provide universal coverage want to end up in the same situation we're in right now, with an over-bloated government determined to take care of everything our nation needs. Universal health coverage will impose taxes on many people who need jobs and don't make enough money for this arrangement, while also making it impossible for them to get any benefits from their own\nGroup A: Universal health care is a popular topic of discussion among those who are not satisfied with their current system. If the government takes over and pays for your health care, they will make all the decisions about how much it costs and what kind of coverage you get.\n\n\nGroup B: human right. However, in America, health care only becomes accessible to people who end up with jobs that offer it. So part of the way we need to solve the problem is by pushing legislation to make sure all Americans are insured; not just those fortunate enough to live near an employer with benefits or who can afford healthcare on their own. We really do need universal health care like Canada for this reason\nGroup B: Poor Americans who need health care and do not have the money to pay for it typically rely on Medicaid. Medicaid is a government-funded program that provides financial assistance to those who cannot afford medical visits, surgeries, or prescriptions. However, this is not enough. The program has gaps in coverage that are often difficult or impossible for low income families to fill with their own funds alone.\nGroup B: I was diagnosed with asthma in my early twenties, so I have had health insurance for most of my adult life.

Proponents of universal health care often make the argument that it is a human right and would be more cost-effective for governments than private insurance. Opponents argue that universal health care could result in lower quality of life, longer wait times, and increased taxes for those who are currently healthy.\nGroup A: in America. Contrary to popular rumor, it would actually be cheaper with universal health care due to administrative simplification and less variable costs among citizens.Nevertheless, one of the major reasons why people are against this is because they fear change. A new system would greatly alter the government's power structure which many Americans are wary of losing or see as an unnecessary act that compromises their\nGroup A: is sustainable. How are we supposed to pay for the millions of people who want to be treated? Health insurance costs are skyrocketing, and it's because health care providers have no financial incentive to keep prices proportional with quality. Without cost-sharing, which will create a system where those who can't afford it have access, they'll take advantage of the free service\n\n\nGroup B: The United States should implement a universal health care program because it's better for everyone. Universal health care means that we would all be covered, and we wouldn't have to worry about the costs of medical bills.\nGroup B: It is imperative that we have a universal health care system in place for all Americans. The Affordable Care Act has done a lot to get us closer to this, but there is still so much work left to be done.\nGroup B: I was diagnosed with asthma in my early twenties, so I have had health insurance for most of my adult life. My health care has never been an issue for me, but it is something that worries me about the future. It is easy to see how our country's current system could be improved by implementing universal healthcare.\nGroup B: Government health care, which is also known as single-payer health care or guaranteed issue, is a system under which everyone receives coverage from one organization.In the United States, government agencies have been experimenting with this type of system since 1969.
