            <p> <b>Please read the examples carefully; the qualification is extremely easy after you read this instruction, but if you don't read it you might not be able to pass.</b></p>

            <br/><br/>

            Task Definition: In this task, you will check whether a TEXT satisfies a PROPERTY<br/><br/>
            Example 1:<br/>
            Property: mentions a natural scene.<br/>
            Text: I love the way the sun sets in the evening.<br/><br/>
            Option A) Certainly Yes.<br/>
            Option B) Likely Yes.<br/>
            Option C) Neutral<br/>
            Option D) Likely No.<br/>
            Option E) Certainly No.<br/>
            Option F) Confusing/Cannot be decided.
            Answer: A<br/>
            Explanation: sun set is nature-related; if you feel a bit ambivalent, B is also acceptable.<br/><br/>

            Example 2:<br/>
            Property: writes in a 1st person perspective.<br/>
            Text: Jacob is smart.<br/><br/>
            Option A) Certainly Yes.<br/>
            Option B) Likely Yes.<br/>
            Option C) Neutral<br/>
            Option D) Likely No.<br/>
            Option E) Certainly No.<br/>
            Option F) Confusing/Cannot be decided.
            Answer: E<br/>
            Explanation: This text is undoubtedly written in the 3rd person perspetive, so E.<br/><br/>

            Example 3:<br/>
            Property: is better than group B.<br/>
            Text: I also need to buy a chair.<br/><br/>
            Option A) Certainly Yes.<br/>
            Option B) Likely Yes.<br/>
            Option C) Neutral<br/>
            Option D) Likely No.<br/>
            Option E) Certainly No.<br/>
            Option F) Confusing/Cannot be decided.
            Answer: F<br/>
            Explanation: It is unclear what the hypothesis mean (e.g., what does group B mean?) and doesn't seem related to the text. So F.<br/><br/>

            Example 4:<br/>
            Property: mentions that the breakfast is good on the airline.<br/>
            Text: The airline staff was really nice! Enjoyable flight.<br/><br/>
            Option A) Certainly Yes.<br/>
            Option B) Likely Yes.<br/>
            Option C) Neutral<br/>
            Option D) Likely No.<br/>
            Option E) Certainly No.<br/>
            Option F) Confusing/Cannot be decided.
            Answer: E<br/>
            Explanation: Although the text appreciates the flight experience, it DOES NOT mention about the breakfast. So the answer is E.<br/><br/>

            Example 5:<br/>
            Property: appreciates the writing style of the author.<br/>
            Text: The paper absolutely sucks because its underlying logic is wrong. However, the presentation of the paper is clear and the use of language is really impressive.<br/><br/>
            Option A) Certainly Yes.<br/>
            Option B) Likely Yes.<br/>
            Option C) Neutral<br/>
            Option D) Likely No.<br/>
            Option E) Certainly No.<br/>
            Option F) Confusing/Cannot be decided.
            Answer: A<br/>
            Explanation: Although the text dislikes the paper, it DOES like the writing style. So the answer is A.<br/><br/>

            !!BE CAREFUL!!: the property we will ask you to compare can change from page to page, so make sure you read the property carefully.<br/><br/>
